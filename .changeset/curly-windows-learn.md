pr: #3036
@author: @davidkpiano

Changed `getSimplePaths` to `getSimplePlans`, and `getShortestPaths` to `getShortestPlans`. Both of these functions now return `StatePlan[]`.

Added functions `traverseSimplePlans`, `traverseSimplePlansTo` and `traverseSimplePlansFromTo`, to allow for traversal of `StatePlan[]` generated by `getSimplePlans`.

Added functions `traverseShortestPaths` and `traverseShortestPlansFromTo` to allow for traversal of `StatePlan[]` generated by `getShortestPlans`.
